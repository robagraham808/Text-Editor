AS A developer

I WANT to create notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection

SO THAT I can reliably retrieve them for later use

I have built a text editor that runs in the browser. This is a single-page application that meets all of the PWA requirements. It also features a

lot of data persistence techniques, these techniques work as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. 

The application will also function offline.
